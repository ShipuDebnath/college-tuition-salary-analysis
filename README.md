# College Tuition and Salary Potential Analysis

## Overview
This project merges tuition and salary datasets to plot in-state tuition against early and mid-career pay for 4-year colleges, highlighting Texas Tech (TTU) and Rice University with custom colors.

## Dependencies
- R (>= 4.0)
- Packages: `tidyverse`
- Install: `install.packages("tidyverse")`

## Data
- Source: `tuition_cost` and `salary_potential` datasets (e.g., .csv files)
- Location: `/data/tuition_cost.csv` and `/data/salary_potential.csv` (include files or links)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/college-tuition-salary-analysis.git`
2. Open R and set the working directory to the repo folder.
3. Load data (e.g., `tuition_cost <- read.csv("data/tuition_cost.csv")`).
4. Run the script: `source("scripts/college_analysis.R")`
5. Outputs:
   - Plots in `plots/` (e.g., TTU early career plot)
   - Processed data in `data/college_processed.csv`

## Key Findings
- TTU and Rice positioned relative to other colleges in cost vs. pay.
- Visual insights into public/private type differences.
